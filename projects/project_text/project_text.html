<title>Signage and Text Localization</title>

<xmp theme="cerulean" style="display:none;">
Signage and text localization is to extract the regions containing signage symbols and text strings from images/videos.
Signage symbols and text strings provide unambiguous and concise information about their surrounding environments, so they always play a signficiant role in many computer vision applications, such as scene understanding, geo-coding, content-based image retrieval, assistive navigation, and SLAM.

In image/video examples, signage and text is always embedded into clutterred background, and there is no fixed patterns of signage symbols and text strings.
Most existing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems are applied only to signage/text regions, where the background outliers from the images/videos have been eliminated.
